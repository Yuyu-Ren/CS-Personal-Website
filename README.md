# CS-Personal-Website

## TODO List:

// don't put "done", just mark these out <3

- [ ] Structure filepaths for site.com/path/ instead of site.com/path.html
- [ ] Maybe add a note section for all the courses taken. LaTeX integrated on site?
- [ ] Add contact info
- [ ] Change the background of these photos to something more related to school.
- [ ] Add resume and crap
- [ ] Maybe add site borders? Right now it's just FLAT OMG SO FLAT LIKE HOLY SHIT
- [ ] Each page and their respective course could have a different background or something, and then you I ~~slepth through~~ learned
- [ ] Change site color?
- [ ] Add a footer with all the fancy info and stuffs.
- [ ] Could try and see if a background fade from one color to another as you scroll down is possible. (f l a m b o y a n t a e s t h e t i c s)
  - Look into these?
    - https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_fade.asp
    - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-jquery
- [ ] Replace the document button with a fractal-generated Icon? Seems like having my icon twice is super annoying.
- [ ] Navbar needs more buttons and dropdown menus
- [ ] Robots.txt to disable google searching??
- [ ] Cool transition element for the clubsection.
- [ ] Turn the navbar from an opacity hack to an actual navbar full dark to opaque transition. Right now, the bar behind it can be seen.
  - Look into background-filter (safari-only atm) css
- [ ] Scroll to top button?
- [ ] firefox dies when you try to access index.html offline
  - AppCache?
- [ ] firefox dies when you hit refresh a ton
  - Probably just FF tbh
- [ ] Move algorithms and Big O to portfolio <li><a href="bap.html">Algorithms and Big O</a></li>
- [ ] Change the navmenu to something neater looking?
- [x] Be amazing :heart:
